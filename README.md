# What is foodify?
  Foodify is the website created in order to lessen the food wastage. This will help to connect the manager/owner of banquet to the NGOs who further can distribute this food to the people in need. 

# Purpose of the project
  There have been a lot of surveys conducted which proved after an event, there’s a lot of food left which ultimately gets dumped. In order to lessen this wastage and feed the people who could not even get a whole meal, this website have been created. Our aim is to connect the owner/manager of banquet halls where such food is left to the NGOs who tend to distribute this food to the needy people.

# Scope of the project
  This project can spread worldwide. Even a plate of food saved can make one hungry individual satisfy. On the auspicious events, what best can happen rather to serve food to the hunger stomach.

# Challenges Faced
  As many of us were new to the world of programming and had no idea about web development. So, we learned about languages like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Python, Django, Git, Github, etc. from the internet that we could make our own website. Even though the thought of making a website seemed to be daunting at first. As we moved further on in the project the website started taking shape. Seeing that 1 week ago many of us didn’t know anything about web development and now we were able to make a functional website was quite amazing. Working in a team was also a new experience for us , we enjoyed a lot while collaborating and making something together. We hope you would appreciate the hardwork we had put in to make this website.
