# What is foodify?
  Foodify is the website created in order to lessen the food wastage. This will help to connect the manager/owner of banquet to the NGOs who further can distribute this food to the people in need. 

# Purpose of the project
  There have been a lot of surveys conducted which proved after an event, thereâ€™s a lot of food left which ultimately gets dumped. In order to lessen this wastage and feed the people who could not even get a whole meal, this website have been created. Our aim is to connect the owner/manager of banquet halls where such food is left to the NGOs who tend to distribute this food to the needy people.

# Scope of the project
  This project can spread worldwide. Even a plate of food saved can make one hungry individual satisfy. On the auspicious events, what best can happen rather to serve food to the hunger stomach.
